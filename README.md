### Autohotkey + C++ runtime
made to do more complex parts in C++ and then seamlessly use them in autohotkey

it solved my problem of needing to write ton of autohotkey code just to swap basic stuff such as boolean from true/false


### Currently supports
- automated GUI generation in ImGui
- runtime variable/function editing

#### nearly fully autogenerated UI
